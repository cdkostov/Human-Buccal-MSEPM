# Human-Buccal-MSEPM
Analyze epigenetic methylation data from human buccal cells to identify which chromosomal regions are good predictors for traits using the MSEPM machine-learning model.

This repo contains the code I used to create a thesis about the possible link of certain transciption factors to obesity on an epigenetic level. This research was done independently, but under the guidance of UCLA faculty.
